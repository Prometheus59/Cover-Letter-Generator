# Cover Letter Generator

This is a cover letter generator that I only used a handful of times. While this is not a tool that I'd recommend (its best to tailer a cover letter to a job if you're going to do it at all) i'm leaving it here as a learning tool  to refer to later in learning the electon platform.

## To Use

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash

### Customizing Application
The index.html file needs to be edited for how you want your letter to read.
Then you need to enter the information specific to the job (Company name, job position, skills pertinent to job)
Please do not enter any punctuation.

### Copying Text
After generating the message, you can press the copy text button to copy the message to post it to online job postings.

Note: If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.
